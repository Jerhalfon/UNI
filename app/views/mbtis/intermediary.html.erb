I guess the most important or the most obvious thing about me is I’m a bit of an introvert. I mean, I’m always the wallflower. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like being around people. I actually love it. I thrive on deep conversations where I feel a strong connection with someone. And I’d like to think I’m a good listener and a good conversationalist. Maybe it’s because I don’t like to talk about myself so I’m always asking others questions about themselves. I also love to play football and love to watch movies and to read book in holydays.
