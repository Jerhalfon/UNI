The Big Five isn’t the only way psychologists think about personality, but it’s the one that has the most scientific research behind it (thousands of studies involving millions of participants). Research studies have connected the Big Five to just about everything: our relationships, career preferences, moods and temperment, music preferences, physiology, and, of course, the words we use to describe ourselves and other people.  The Big Five Personality dimensions are Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion (or Introversion), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, or OCEAN, for short.The Big Five isn’t the only way psychologists think about personality, but it’s the one that has the most scientific research behind it (thousands of studies involving millions of participants).

I guess the most important or the most obvious thing about me is I’m a bit of an introvert. I mean, I’m always the wallflower. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like being around people. I actually love it. I thrive on deep conversations where I feel a strong connection with someone. And I’d like to think I’m a good listener and a good conversationalist. Maybe it’s because I don’t like to talk about myself so I’m always asking others questions about themselves. I also love to play football and love to watch movies and to read book in holydays.
