My name is Jeremy Halfon, I am 19 years old and Iâ€™ve just finished high school last year. I really enjoyed learning new things and my favorite subjects at school were economy, languages and informatics. Next to school I am also really into blockchain and crypto currencies. Later on I would love to create my own one by learning C++ for example. Today I am trading bitcoin and alts but I would love to broader my range to other currencies to diversify my portfolio. I am someone quite open and I love to work together in teams to solve problems.
