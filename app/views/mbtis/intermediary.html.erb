With this letter I would like to express my strong interest for the Fintech analyst position McKinsey & Company is offering. Driven by a passion in finance and technology, I strongly believe my values and drivers are aligned with what you stand for and what the position requires. McKinsey is an attractive company known for its excellent work and most reputable consulting firm worldwide offering challenging and rewarding work which is most appealing to me.
My academic journey started at the University of Maastricht where I completed my Bachelor of Economics and Business. This provided me with a strong base of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, which in turn created a strong interest in finance. The Masterâ€™s in Financial Management at Vlerick Business School allowed me to further develop this interest while improving my analytical and professional skills. Both experiences led me to keep up tight but structured time schedules while delivering qualitative work with high attention to detail. 
I gained a first international experience at Singapore Management University during the last semester of my bachelor as an exchange program. In addition, I took the opportunity to do an internship in Madagascar in a maturing digital start up. My two foreign experiences have not only taught me how to understand the local cultures and needs of local people but most importantly how to adapt to those cultures and changing needs. Combined with my experience as a consulting intern at a reputable company and other summer jobs, I can confidently say that I have a strong foundation for good communication and interpersonal competences, which is key to achieve results, understand customer needs and work in teams. 
While pursuing a career in finance, my deep curiosity in technology has always ensured my close participation in the technological sector. This led me to work in a digital start-up as well as following a three-week bootcamp in Fintech during my Financial master. In addition, I am attending a coding bootcamp as of September at Le Wagon in order to enhance my understanding of the various complexities that lie in financial technologies and its underlying mechanisms. 
I am eager to face a new challenge and believe that working under guidance of experienced professionals, will provide me with the necessary tools to jump-start my career in this fast-changing Economy. I am available for the position as of January 2020. I look forward for a meeting to further discuss my application.
